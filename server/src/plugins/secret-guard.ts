/**
 * Inbound-data guard.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES. Rejects a request whose body looks like a private key
 * or a mnemonic — before the body is parsed, logged, or stored.
 *
 * WHY, IF NO ROUTE ACCEPTS THAT. Because "no route" is a claim about
 * today's code. A route added later may accept a field nobody thought
 * of. The guard turns "the service does not receive secrets" from
 * intent into behavior that does not depend on the next change being
 * careful.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It does not save the user: a secret that went
 * on the wire is already compromised — proxies and the TLS terminator
 * have seen it. The guard limits the damage and makes the mistake
 * visible immediately.
 *
 * REJECTED REQUEST CONTENT IS NOT LOGGED. Recording that a private
 * key arrived is useful; recording the key itself would turn the
 * defense into a leak.

    The attempt was written and dropped: `page.evaluate` runs through
    the debug protocol, which is outside the page policy. Building
    code from a string inside `page.evaluate` succeeds regardless of
    CSP — so such a check would measure the test harness, not the
    defense, and would create false confidence.

    `script-src` (the check above) and injected code cannot run by
    the paths XSS actually uses — those go through the page itself,

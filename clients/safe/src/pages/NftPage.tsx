/**
 * Collectible tokens of the active account.
 *
 * THE LIST IS BUILT IN TWO STEPS, AND THAT IS NOT REDUNDANT. A node
 * cannot answer "what belongs to this address": first inflows are
 * found in logs, then each contract is asked whether the item still
 * belongs to the owner. A list from logs alone would show given-away
 * items as owned.
 *
 * THE OWNER STARTS THE SEARCH BY OPENING THE SECTION. It is dozens of
 * node calls and a detailed activity trail at the operator: doing it
 * on every unlock would pay for something nobody asked for.
 *
 * THERE ARE NO IMAGES, AND THAT IS A DECISION, NOT A GAP. Their URLs
 * are set by the contract author; loading them would reveal the
 * owner's IP to an arbitrary server and let it be tied to the wallet.
 * Collection name, contract address, and item id are enough to
 * recognize the item.

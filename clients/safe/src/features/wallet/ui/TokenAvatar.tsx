/**
 * Token mark.
 *
 * Why a live logo is not loaded. Three independent reasons, each
 * enough on its own.
 *
 * First — CSP. Production allows images only from our build and
 * `data:`. A third-party logo host would be blocked, and weakening
 * the policy for decoration is not allowed.
 *
 * Second — privacy. The set of requested logos tells the host the
 * user's portfolio and ties it to an IP. A wallet built around
 * non-disclosure cannot open that leak for a picture.
 *
 * Third — fakes. A fraudulent contract with ticker `USDC` and the
 * real USDC logo is indistinguishable from the original.
 *
 * What changed. The first two still forbid a network fetch; marks
 * now live in the build, so no third-party request happens.
 *
 * The third flips if the mark is granted by (chain, contract)
 * checked against the built-in registry, not by ticker. Real USDC
 * gets the mark; a fake with the same ticker does not. The mark
 * became an authenticity signal instead of bait. See
 * `findTokenLogo`.
 *
 * Other tokens keep an address fingerprint: color is derived from
 * the address, the contract author cannot pick it, and two
 * different contracts look different even with matching tickers.

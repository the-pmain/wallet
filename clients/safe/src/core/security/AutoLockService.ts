/**
 * Idle auto-lock.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. An unlocked wallet holds the root key derived from
 * the seed phrase in memory. While the session is open, anyone who
 * gets the device can move funds without the password. Auto-lock
 * bounds that window by time, not by trust in the surroundings.
 *
 * THE CORE DOES NOT KNOW ABOUT BROWSER EVENTS. The service counts
 * time and listens to nothing: keypresses and pointer moves are
 * tracked by the app layer, which reports them via `notifyActivity`.
 * Otherwise the core would stop working in a service worker, where
 * there is no DOM.
 *
 * THE SERVICE DOES NOT LOCK THE WALLET ITSELF. It reports that the
 * timeout expired; the session owner performs the lock. The split
 * keeps the shutdown order — stop polling, drop connections, wipe
 * the key — in one place.
 *
 * THERE ARE NO EXCEPTIONS FOR "IMPORTANT SCREENS". A carve-out
 * "do not lock while the send form is open" would make the
 * protection optional: leave that form open.

/**
 * Content-Security-Policy for the production build.
 *
 * Directives are intentionally narrow:
 * - `script-src 'self'`   — only bundle code runs. Any inline script
 *                           injected via XSS is blocked by the browser.
 * - `object-src 'none'`   — no plugins (Flash, PDF-embed, and the like).
 * - `base-uri 'self'`     — blocks base-URL swap (base-tag injection).
 *
 * `style-src` must include `'unsafe-inline'`: Radix UI and Tailwind
 * animations set inline styles via the `style` attribute. That does
 * not execute code, but CSS injection would need a revisit.
 *
 * `connect-src` ALLOWS ANY HTTPS BY DEFAULT, A DELIBERATE TRADE.
 * The user may point at their own RPC node — an address unknown at
 * build time. A list built from built-in networks would cancel that,
 * and that is the main request-privacy defense: without their own
 * node, the foreign operator sees the IP and every owner address.
 *
 * THE HOST MAY CHOOSE OTHERWISE. Build variable
 * `VITE_CSP_CONNECT_SRC` sets the source list explicitly — e.g. for
 * a host that does not expect a custom node, where blocking arbitrary
 * destinations matters more. The one who serves the build chooses,
 * because they bear the consequences.
 *
 * `https:` also covers `wss:`: the CSP spec maps the `https` scheme
 * to secure websockets. A separate entry is not needed, and its
 * absence does not mean WalletConnect is banned.

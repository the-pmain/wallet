 * another page is a signature the owner made while aiming at another
 * button.
 *

 * hand-written directive lists diverge on the first change, and the
 * divergence is silent: the build passes, tests pass, and the live
 * policy is weaker than the declared one.

 * Everything else is closed explicitly: listing only what is needed
